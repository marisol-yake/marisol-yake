<!-- Intro, Skills and Interests -->
<!-- Hello and welcome to my Github profile! My name is Marikit Yake and I'm working on writing this intro. -->
Hello there! I'm Marisol Yake, my pronouns are she/they, and I'm currently working as an Data Analyst for [Mountain Museum Management (MMM)](https://www.museum-mgmt.com/) where we are hard at work co-developing the [Collections & Data Analysis (CADA)](https://www.museum-mgmt.com/cada) pilot project. After extensive research and project development, we are rolling out our first project demonstrations ([available here](https://github.com/marisol-yake/MMM-museum-analytics)) and beginning the process of museum client on-boarding.

Prior to my work with MMM, I worked most recently as an undergraduate research asssitant conducting research regarding Human-Computer Interactions at CU Boulder with the [Philanthropic Informatics Research Lab (PIRL)](https://amy.voida.com/research-group/), conducting independent research under the direct supervision of [Amy Voida, PhD](https://amy.voida.com/) and [Shiva Darian, PhD](https://smdarian.github.io/). We examined how labor unions use data and information technology to support labor power in the workplace, which culminated in contribution to a research manuscript for publication.
